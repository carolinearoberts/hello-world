# Purpose of this Repository #

The purpose of this repository is to help me learn how to use `GitHub`. My work on `GitHub` is to aid my graduate school research.

# Getting Started with `GitHub` #

For a `GitHub` tutorial, I first used the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) site [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com). This resourse is promoted by `GitHub` to help new users learn to: Create and use a repository, Start and manage a new branch, Make changes to a file and push them to `GitHub` as commits, and Open and merge a pull request.
